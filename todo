What I need to easily configure servers?
Master-server with:
	byobu (with my config)
	ssh
	fileserver (sftp mount!!! and samba for windows )
Servers with:
	root ssh access (custom config)
	no password auth (ssh-copy-id)
	one network (in vm settings)
	micro editor if possible
	auto mount network folder from Master
	config to remove it
	Scripts need to be configured with ENV varibales!!!!!, so script to set them up

So I will connect from host to master server, run byobu and connect to other hosts.
